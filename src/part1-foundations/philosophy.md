# Philosophy & Approach

## The Core Challenge: Harmony-First Composers and Melodic Thinking

For composers whose natural orientation is vertical (harmonic) rather than horizontal (melodic), developing strong motivic thinking requires deliberate practice. This curriculum systematically builds linear thinking through what Schoenberg called **"developing variation"**—the technique of generating extended musical structures from minimal motivic material.

## Timbre First, Then Structure

Following the wisdom of contemporary composition pedagogy: **timbre first**. Before worrying about formal architecture, we explore the inner beauty of sound—its color, its breath, its life-power. This is especially true in solo wind writing, where the instrument's voice *is* the composition.

## The Cell as Generative Seed

A **cell** is the smallest unit of musical material that contains recognizable character. It might be:
- A rhythmic figure
- An intervallic pattern
- A gestural shape
- A timbral event

From this seed, entire pieces grow through transformation, development, and recombination.

## Historical Forms as Scaffolding

We don't reinvent the wheel. Baroque forms—the fantasia, the dance suite, the division—provide time-tested structures that can support contemporary harmonic language. The container is old; the contents are new.

## Constrained Creativity

Paradoxically, **constraints liberate**. By limiting pitch collections, rhythmic values, or registral range, we force creative solutions that wouldn't emerge in unlimited freedom. This curriculum uses constrained exercises extensively.

## Practice Over Analysis

While analysis informs composition, this curriculum emphasizes **doing**. Every technique is immediately applied in compositional exercises. Understanding comes through making.

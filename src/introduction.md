# Introduction

*From Cell to Score* is a living curriculum designed to accompany nine semesters of private composition instruction at Berklee Online. It provides a parallel track of self-study focused on **cell-based compositional techniques**—the art of building compelling motives, assembling them into phrases, and transforming them across movements and forms.

## Who This Book Is For

This curriculum is designed for:

- **Advanced adult learners** with existing theoretical knowledge seeking to deepen their compositional craft
- **Harmony-first composers** who want to develop stronger melodic and motivic thinking
- **Students of contemporary composition** interested in 20th/21st-century approaches to cell-based writing
- **Anyone following a private instruction sequence** who wants structured self-study material

## How to Use This Book

The book is organized in three parts:

1. **Foundations** — Core concepts, resources, and techniques that underpin the entire curriculum
2. **The Nine Semesters** — Detailed guides for each semester, mapping Berklee requirements to cell-based learning objectives
3. **Daily Practices** — Exercises and étude progressions to build compositional habits

Each semester chapter follows a consistent structure:
- **Berklee Requirements** — What the official syllabus expects
- **Cell-to-Score Focus** — Our parallel learning objectives
- **Repertoire to Study** — Scores and recordings to analyze
- **Compositional Projects** — Pieces to compose
- **Reflection & Notes** — Space for your observations and discoveries

## The Spiral Structure

This curriculum follows Jerome Bruner's **spiral curriculum** principle: techniques are introduced, then revisited at increasing levels of complexity. A transformation technique learned in Semester 1 for solo recorder will return in Semester 4 in a chamber context, and again in Semester 7 at orchestral scale.

## A Living Document

This book is designed to grow. As you progress through your studies, add your reflections, discoveries, and compositions. The Reflection sections are there for you to document what works, what challenges you, and how your compositional voice develops.

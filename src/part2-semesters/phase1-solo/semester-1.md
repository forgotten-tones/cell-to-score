# Semester 1: Solo Instrument — Gestural Vocabulary

> *"Timbre first! The inner beauty of the colour of sound."*

## Overview

Semester 1 focuses on building a **gestural vocabulary** for solo instrument. While Berklee's syllabus addresses "solo instrument excluding piano," we are taking the unusual and rewarding path of exploring the **tenor recorder**—an instrument with deep Renaissance and Baroque roots but significant contemporary repertoire.

The core question: **How does a solo piece hold together without accompaniment?**

## Dual Track

| Berklee Focus | Cell-to-Score Focus |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Solo piece for instrument | Building motives, defining gestures |
| Contemporary styles | 20th/21st-century cell techniques |
| Form and coherence | Gestural vocabulary as structural glue |
| Professional notation | Score as compositional document |

## Key Concepts This Semester

- **Gesture** as the organizing principle of solo wind writing
- **Breath** as structural punctuation
- **Registral stratification** creating implied polyphony
- **Motivic economy** — maximum expression from minimal material
- **Timbre-first** approach to sound and technique

## Timeline

Given advanced preparation, the standard syllabus requirements may be satisfied in **weeks 1-4**, with remaining weeks devoted to extended exploration (extended techniques, additional forms, or early chamber preparation).

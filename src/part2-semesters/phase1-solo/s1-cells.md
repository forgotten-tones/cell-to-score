# Semester 1: Cell-to-Score Focus

## Learning Objectives

While Berklee focuses on producing a complete solo work, our parallel track develops the **foundational skills of cell-based composition**:

### 1. Building Compelling Motives

- Generate motives (3-5 notes) with distinct rhythmic and intervallic character
- Understand what makes a motive *memorable* and *generative*
- Practice daily motive journaling

### 2. Defining a Gestural Vocabulary

- Identify **3-5 characteristic gestures** for your piece:
  - Attack profiles (sudden vs. gradual)
  - Contour patterns (ascending, falling, arch, wave)
  - Rhythmic figures (long-short, repeated, accelerating)
  - Dynamic shapes (swell, decay, sforzando)
- Each gesture should be recognizable and transformable

### 3. Basic Transformation Techniques

- **Augmentation** — stretching durations
- **Diminution** — compressing durations
- **Inversion** — flipping intervals
- **Retrograde** — reversing order
- **Fragmentation** — using part of the motive
- **Sequence** — transposing repetition

### 4. Pitch Organization

- Work within a **limited pitch collection** (mode, scale, or pitch-class set)
- Explore Messiaen's modes of limited transposition as harmonic/melodic generators
- Understand how pitch constraints force creative solutions

### 5. Breath-Centered Phrase Structure

- Use breath as compositional element, not just technical necessity
- Explore Hosokawa's concept of breath as "life-power"
- Plan phrase lengths around natural breathing

## Connection to Variego Workbook

Complete these exercises from *Composing with Constraints*:
- **Chapter 1**: Melody exercises #1-10 (custom scales, interval cycles)
- **Chapter 2**: Rhythm exercises #1-5 (rhythmic motives)

## Technique Thread

This semester **introduces**:
- Gestural vocabulary
- Basic motivic transformation
- Pitch organization through constraint

These will be **expanded** in Semester 3 (chamber dialogue) and **mastered** in Semesters 7-8 (orchestral scale).

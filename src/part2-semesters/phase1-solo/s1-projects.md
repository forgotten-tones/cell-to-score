# Semester 1: Compositional Projects

## Main Project: Solo Tenor Recorder Piece (2-3 minutes)

### Constraints
- **Single pitch collection**: Choose one Messiaen mode or a custom 6-8 note collection
- **Maximum 3-5 defined gestures**: Each must be recognizable and transformable
- **Breath-centered phrasing**: Plan phrase lengths around natural breathing
- **No extended techniques yet**: Focus on pitch, rhythm, and gesture first

### Process
1. **Week 1-2**: Explore the pitch collection; generate 5-10 motive candidates
2. **Week 3-4**: Select 2-3 motives; define gestural vocabulary
3. **Week 5-8**: Compose the piece using transformation techniques
4. **Week 9-10**: Refine, notate professionally, create mockup
5. **Week 11-12**: Final polish, prepare for professor feedback

### Deliverable
- Professional score (PDF)
- Audio mockup (using Versilian tenor recorder samples)
- Brief composer's note explaining pitch organization and gestural vocabulary

## Étude Projects (Weekly)

### Étude 1: Motive Generation
- Compose 5 distinct motives (3-5 notes each)
- For each, create 3 transformations
- Select the most promising for development

### Étude 2: Single-Gesture Study
- 30-second piece using only ONE gesture
- Explore all possible variations of that gesture

### Étude 3: Breath Study
- Compose focusing on breath as structure
- Vary phrase lengths deliberately
- Inspired by Hosokawa approach

### Étude 4: Register Exploration
- Map the tenor recorder's range
- Compose a study moving through all registers
- Note which areas have most expressive potential

### Étude 5: Pitch-Class Constraint
- 1-minute piece using only 4 pitches
- Maximum constraint, maximum creativity

## Off-Syllabus Extension (if time permits)

If Berklee requirements are satisfied by week 4:
- **Extended techniques exploration**: Multiphonics, breath sounds, microtones
- **Second piece**: 3-5 minute fantasia incorporating extended techniques
- **Historical form study**: Compose a modern sarabande or allemande
